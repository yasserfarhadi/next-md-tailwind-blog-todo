The landscape of web development is rapidly evolving, with new technologies and trends continuously shaping the future of the industry. Staying informed about these developments is crucial for developers to remain competitive and innovative.

# WebAssembly

WebAssembly (Wasm) is an emerging technology that allows high-performance code to run in the browser. It provides a way to execute code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust alongside JavaScript, enabling more complex and resource-intensive applications.

# Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

PWAs offer a native app-like experience on the web. They are designed to work offline, load quickly, and provide a reliable user experience across different devices and network conditions. PWAs combine the best of web and mobile applications, offering improved performance and engagement.
